# Golang Playground

Welcome to my Golang Playground! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is a collection of Go examples and exercises that I'll be working on daily. My goal is to dive into a wide range of topics in Go, from the basics to more advanced concepts. Each day, I'll tackle a new topic (or sometimes two or three, depending on how tricky they are) and add my notes, examples, and explanations here.

### What to Expect

- **Daily Updates:** I'll be updating this repo daily with new topics. Some days will focus on simple concepts like variables or loops, while others might dive into more complex subjects like goroutines or channels.
- **Readable Code:** The code in each topic is meant to be straightforward and easy to understand. Iâ€™ll try to keep it clean and well-commented so that anyone can follow along, whether youâ€™re a beginner or someone looking to refresh their Go skills.

- **Explanations:** Along with the code, I'll include explanations and notes in each topicâ€™s README. The idea is to break down whatâ€™s happening and why, so itâ€™s not just about writing code but also understanding the logic behind it.

### Topics Covered

Iâ€™ll be covering a broad range of topics including:

- **Basic Syntax:** Variables, constants, loops, conditions, etc.
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, slices, maps, structs, etc.
- **Concurrency:** Goroutines, channels, select statements, etc.
- **Error Handling:** Custom errors, panic, recover, etc.
- **Advanced Topics:** Generics, interfaces, struct embedding, etc.

And much more!
